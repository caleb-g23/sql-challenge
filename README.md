# sql-challenge
# Backround
Itâ€™s been two weeks since I was hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). My first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, I will design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, I will perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

Completed working with cohort member Andrew Hawthorne
